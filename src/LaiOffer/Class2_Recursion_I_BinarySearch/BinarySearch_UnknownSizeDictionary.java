package LaiOffer.Class2_Recursion_I_BinarySearch;

/**
 * Apply binary search in checking whether an element is in an unknown size dictionary or not
 * <p>
 * Variant 2.0 application:
 * Given a sorted dictionary with unknown size, how to determine whether a word is in this dictionary or not.
 * <p>
 * Example: dictionary[x] = {1 3 5 7 9 ... 1000 ... 1000000 ...}, target = 9999
 * Assumption if a[indexï¼½== NULL then we know the size of dictionary is < index
 * <p>
 * Jump by 2 times VS Jump by 10 times
 * To jump out: log2(n) VS log10(n)
 * To jump in: log2(2n) VS log2(10n)
 * Compare:
 * 10 times - 2 times
 * = log10(n) + log2(10n) - log2(n) - log2(2n)
 * = log10(n) - log2(n) + log2(10n / 2n)
 * = log10(n) - log2(n) + log2(5) (close to 2.5)
 * log10(n) is much smaller than log2(n)
 * Conclusion: jump 10 steps is faster than 2 steps
