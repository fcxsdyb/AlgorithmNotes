    /**
     * Definition:
     * Heap, also known as priority queue.
     *
     * Properties:
     * 1. All the nodes are less than their children nodes, the smallest node is in the root of the heap.
     * 2. Heap is always a complete binary tree.
     * 3. The heap with the largest root node is called the max heap, with the smallest root node is called mim heap.
     * 4. index of left child = index of parent * 2 + 1
     * 5. index of right child = index of parent * 2 + 2
     * 6. unsorted but follow the rules above
     *
     * Supported operations:
     * 1. insert: add a new element into the heap. Time complexity is O(log n).
     * 2. update: let new element follow the rules by the heap. Time Complexity is O(log n).
     * 3. get/top: get the root element of the heap. Time Complexity is O(1).
     * 4. pop: remove the root element of the heap. Time Complexity is O(log n).
     * 5. heapify: make a unsorted array into a heap. Time Complexity is O(n).
