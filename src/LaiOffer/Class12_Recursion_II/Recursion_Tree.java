     * 5. Recursion与Tree的结合
     * Binary tree 往往是最常见的，和recursion 结合最紧密的面试题目类型。
     * Reasons: 每层的node具备的性质，传递的值和下一层的性质往往一致。比较容易定义recursive rule。
     * Base case (generally): null pointer under the leaf node
     * 5.1: int getHeight (Node root)
     * 5.2: 统计tree里边有多少个node？
     *
     * The way of thinking
     * 1. What do you expect from your lchild / rchild? (Usually it is the return type of the recursion function)
     * 2. What do you want to do in the current layer?
     * 3. What do you want to report to your parent?
     *
     * 5.3 find the node with the max difference in the total number of descendents in its left subtree and right subtree
