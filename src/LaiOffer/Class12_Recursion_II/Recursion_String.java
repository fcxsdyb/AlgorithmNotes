     * Given a string and an abbreviation, return if the string matches the abbreviation.
     * Assume the original string only contains alphabetic characters. For example: "s11d" matches "sophisticated".
     * Abbreviation matching
     *
     * base case: if two string both size are 0, return true; if only one of it is 0, return false
     * recursion rule:
     * if we get a digit, check length and check the rest character after given length.
     * if we get a character, try to match the character with the given string.
