     * What is recursion?
     * Review: What is recursion (again)?
     *
     * 需要掌握的知识点:
     * 1. 表象上: Function calls itself
     * 2. 实质上: Boil down a big problem to smaller ones (size n depends on size n-1, or n-2 or ... n/2)
     * 3. Implementation上:
     *      a） 1. Base case: smallest problem to solve
     *      b） 2. Recursive rule. how to make the problem smaller (if we can resolve the same problem
     *      but with a smaller size, then what is left to do for the current problem size n）
     * 4? ?
